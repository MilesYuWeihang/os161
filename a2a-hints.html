<li>
Don't forget to re-configure your kernel for
Assignment 2, and to do all of your kernel builds
in <tt>kern/compile/ASST2</tt>

<pre>
% cd $HOME/cs350-os161/os161-1.99/kern/conf
% ./config ASST2
% cd ../compile/ASST2
% bmake depend
% bmake
% bmake install
</pre>
</li>


<br>
<li>
Don't forget that if you add any new source files to the
kernel code, you need to update the file
<tt>kern/conf/conf.kern</tt> and you need to reconfigure
your kernel.
If you don't do this, the code in your new source file will
not be included in the kernel build.
</li>

<br>
<li>
Don't worry about trying to reclaim physical frames
in the kernel when they are no longer used.
However, you should make sure that you kfree
kernel memory that you've allocated using kmalloc
but that the kernel no longer needs.
</li>

<br>
<li>
You may like to have lots of debugging information 
printing out from your kernel, but the kernel you
submit to us must not do so.
OS/161's DEBUG facility that can help with
this problem - you can bury lots of debugging statements
into your code, and you can turn them all off by just
changing the value of a single variable.  You can even
turn them off conditionally by labeling them properly.
<p>
You encountered the <tt>DEBUG</tt> mechanism in A0,
but as a reminder:
<ul>
<li>To use this facility, you just include <tt>DEBUG</tt>
statements into your code instead of <tt>kprintf</tt>,
like this:
<pre>
DEBUG(DB_EXEC, "ELF: Loading %lu bytes to 0x%lx\n", 
     (unsigned long) filesize, (unsigned long) vaddr);
</pre>
The <tt>DEBUG</tt> macro and the various flags
(like <tt>DB_EXEC</tt>) are defined in 
<tt>kern/include/lib.h</tt>.</li>
<li> To control which <tt>DEBUG</tt> statements produce
output, set the <tt>dbflags</tt> variable, which 
is found in <tt>kern/lib/kprintf.c</tt>.
For example, setting

<pre>
u_int32_t dbflags = 0;
</pre>

will turn off all debugging output, while

<pre>
u_int32_t dbflags = DB_EXEC|DB_THREADS;
</pre>

will turn off everything except <tt>DEBUG</tt>
statements that are labeled with
<tt>DB_EXEC</tt> or <tt>DB_THREADS</tt>.</li>
</ul>
</li>


</ol>

<h1> _exit </h1>
<a name="exit"></a>

<ul>
<li>
The partial implementation of <tt>_exit</tt> in the
base OS/161 does not do anything with the exit status
code provided by the the user program.
Your complete implementation of <tt>_exit</tt> should
properly handle the exit status code as described in the
manual pages for <tt>_exit</tt> and <tt>waitpid</tt>.
<p>
Here is something to think about when you do start
worrying about those exit status codes:
a process's exit status code may be needed long after
that process has exited.  Where will you keep the
code, and when will it be safe to forget it?
</li>
</ul>

<h1>passing arguments</h1>
<a name="args"></a>
<ul>
<li>To pass arguments (<tt>argv</tt>) to a user program, you will have to
load the arguments into the program's address space.  In addition
to the argument strings themselves, you have to create the <tt>argv</tt>
array in the user program's address space - <tt>argv</tt> is an array
of pointers to the actual argument strings.</li>
<br>
<li>
Whenever you are loading data into an address space, you must ensure
that it is properly <em>aligned</em>.  Otherwise, the application will cause
addressing exceptions when it tries to access the data.
4-byte items, like character pointers, must start at an address that
is divisible by 4.  So, it would be OK to start your <tt>argv</tt>
array at an address like <tt>0x7fffff08</tt>, but your application
will run in to alignment problems if <tt>argv</tt> starts at an
address like <tt>0x7fffff09</tt> or <tt>0x7fffff0a</tt>, since those
addresses are not divisible by 4.
Characters are only 1 byte long, so there are no alignment issues.
Your argument strings, which are character arrays, can start at any
address.
<p>
A related constraint is that the stack pointer should always start
at an address that is 8-byte aligned (evenly divisible by 8).
This is because the largest data types that require alignment
(and which might be pushed onto a stack) are 8 bytes long, e.g.,
a double-precision floating point value.
</li> 

<li>
Make sure that you understand how <tt>argv</tt> and <tt>argc</tt>
are supposed to work before you try implementing argument passing.
As an example, consider the <tt>testbin/tail</tt> application,
which expects two arguments.  The <tt>main()</tt> function of 
<tt>tail</tt> looks like this:

<pre>
int
main(int argc, char **argv)
{
	int file;

	if (argc < 3) {
		errx(1, "Usage: tail <file> <location>");
	}
	file = open(argv[1], O_RDONLY);
	if (file < 0) {
		err(1, "%s", argv[1]);
	}
	tail(file, atoi(argv[2]), argv[1]);
	close(file);
	return 0;
}
</pre>
<tt>argv</tt> is a character pointer pointer - it points to an
array of character pointers, each of which points to one of the
arguments.   For example, if the <tt>tail</tt> program is
invoked from the kernel command line like this:

<pre>
OS/161 kernel [? for menu]: p testbin/sort foo 100
</pre> 

Then the <tt>argv</tt> and <tt>argc</tt> variables should
be set up as illustrated in the following illustration:
<br>
<img src="argvargc.png">
<br>
A detailed description of the expected set up of 
<tt>argv</tt> and <tt>argc</tt> can be found 
in the <a href="http://www.student.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~cs350/common/os161-man/syscall/execv.html">man page for the <tt>execv</tt> system call</a>.

<h1> open,  close, read, write </h1>
<a name="fileops"></a>

<ul>
<li>
A call like this:
<pre>
result = vfs_open("string", mode, &2vn);
</pre>
is incorrect and should bring a warning from the
compiler.  The problem is that <tt>vfs_open</tt>
may modify its first argument, but 
"string" is an unmodifiable literal.
So if, for example, you want to open the 
console, you need to do something like this
instead:
<pre>
char *console = NULL;
console = kstrdup("con:");
result = vfs_open(console,mode,&vn);
kfree(console);
</pre>
</li>

<li>
<tt>VOP_WRITE</tt>, <tt>VOP_READ</tt>, and other operations
on vnodes want a <tt>uio</tt> structure as a parameter.
<tt>kern/syscall/loadelf.c</tt> contains some useful
examples of <tt>uio</tt> structures being setup and
used for vnode operations.
</li>

<h1> fork </h1>
<a name="fork"></a>

<ul>
<li>To implement fork, you will need to copy the
address space and trap frame from the parent process to
use for the child process.  When you do this, you need to watch
out for potential <i>synchronization problems</i>.  Specifically,
you will need to make sure that the new thread goes not go to
user mode until its address space and trap
frame have been set up.
In addition, you need to make sure that the parent process does not
return to user mode until its address space and trap frame have
been copied.
</li>
</ul>

<h1>Kernel include files</h1>
<a name="includes"></a>

<ul>
<li>If you create a new kernel source (<tt>.c</tt>) file, you will
need to <tt>#include</tt> one or more kernel header files at the
top.   The kernel has some requirements about what you must include,
and about the order in which things must be included. 
In particular, the kernel expects that
<pre>
#include &lsaquo;types.h&rsaquo;
</pre>
will always come first.   For more details and rules about 
<tt>#include</tt>, see the comments at the top of
<tt>kern/include/types.h</tt>.

Symptoms of failure to observe the these rules include 
complaints about errors in header files during kernel compilation.
</li>

<li>
OS/161 kernel header files follow a convention designed to ensure that
headers will not get included twice during any compilation.
For example, the <tt>kern/include/lib.h</tt> includes the following
preprocessor code at the top of the file
<pre>
#ifndef _LIB_H_
#define _LIB_H_ 
</pre>
as well as a corresponding
<pre>
#endif /* _LIB_H_ */
</pre>
at the end of the file.
This ensures that <tt>lib.h</tt> will never be included more than
once during a compilation.   Every other kernel include file 
includes similar code, for the same reason.   If you add a new
header file to your kernel, you should follow a similar convention
to ensure that your header will never be included twice.   Failure
to do so can lead to compilation errors, such as complaints about
multiply-defined symbols or variables.
</li>


</ul>
<!-- --------------------------------------------------------- -->
<hr>
<h1> proper use of kmalloc and kfree </h1>
<a name="kmalloc"></a>

<ul>
<li>
You will need to use kmalloc to dynamically allocate memory for your kernel to use.
When that memory is no longer needed, you need to make it available for later reuse
by calling kfree. For example:

<pre>
kvaddr = kmalloc(size);  /* allocated some memory */

/* do some stuff */

kfree(kvaddr);           /* finished with the memory so free it */
</pre>

<li>
Currently (for Assignment 2)
kfree and the calls it relies on to actually free memory
don't do anything, so memory will not actually be reused (yet).
Assignment 3 often requires completeing the kfree implementation
so that memory is actually freed and is available for reuse.
This permits multiple programs (or kernel tests) to be executed over and over again
without having to reboot the OS.

<li>
So when working on Assignment 2, be sure to use kfree to free memory when it is not longer needed,
otherwise you may have to find these memory leaks when implementing
Assignment 3.


</ul>
<!-- --------------------------------------------------------- -->
<hr>
<h1>testing</h1>
<a name="testing"></a>

<ul>
<li>
There are many OS/161 applications that you can use
to test your kernel.
The source code for many of these applications can be
found under <tt>os161-1.99/user</tt>, in the <tt>testbin</tt>,
<tt>uw-testbin</tt>, <tt>bin</tt> and <tt>sbin</tt> directories.
<p>
You build all of the OS/161 application programs when
you run <tt>bmake</tt> in the directory
<tt>cs350-os161/os161-1.99</tt>.  When you do this,
the application program executable files are copied
into subdirectories under <tt>cs350-os161/root/</tt>.
<p>
Once your OS/161 kernel has booted, you can launch an
application program using the <tt>p</tt> command from
the kernel menu.  For example, to run the <tt>palin</tt>
program, which is located in <tt>testbin</tt>, use the 
following command

<pre>
OS/161 kernel [? for menu]: p testbin/palin
</pre>

As usual, you can pass commands to the kernel on sys161
command line, e.g., 

<pre>
sys161 kernel "p testbin/palin"
</pre>
</li>

<br>
<li>
The amount of memory in the default system is not
very large. For some of the test applications, you may wish to increase 
the amount of memory by modifying the appropriate
line in the <tt>sys161.conf</tt> file.
Note that this must be a multiple of the page size (4096).
For example:

<pre>
# Old/default value
# 31      busctl  ramsize=524288
# Changed to 4 MB.
31      busctl  ramsize=4194304
</pre>

In particular, you will probably have to do this for applications
like <tt>forktest</tt>, <tt>farm</tt> and <tt>sty</tt>.
</li>

<li>
To evaluate the kernel you submit for Assignment 2a, we expect to
use at least the following test programs, with single-processor
and multi-processor configurations:
<dl>
<dt><tt>uw-testbin/onefork</tt></dt>
<dd>this is the simplest test
  of <tt>fork</tt>, and also checks the PIDs returned to the parent
  and child processes</dd>
<dt><tt>uw-testbin/pidcheck</tt></dt>
<dd>this is also a very simple test that
  relies on <tt>fork</tt> and <tt>getpid</tt>.   It can confirm that
  the child PID that the parent sees is the same as the child PID that
  the child sees.</dd>
<dt><tt>uw-testbin/widefork</tt></dt>
<dd> multiple forks, and can also test
  whether exit status values are being passed properly
  through <tt>_exit</tt> to <tt>waitpid</tt></dd>
<dt><tt>testbin/forktest</tt></dt>
<dd>this also performs multiple forks.  It
 relies on proper <tt>waitpid</tt> synchronization, but not on the
exit statuses being returned by <tt>waitpid</tt></dd>
</dl>
If you'd like more details about what these test programs are doing
and what kind of output they produce, please just have a look at
the programs themselves.    The programs are all short, and 
reviewing them is a good way to ensure that
you understand how the system calls work.
</li>
</ul>
